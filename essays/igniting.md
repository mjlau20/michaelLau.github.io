	“There are no dumb questions”. This was said all the time over my academic career. It’s been repeated so much that it goes over my head everytime and I’ve never pondered about it. That is until now. I thought that the statement was true until I learned about smart questions. The quote isn’t entirely wrong, but there are multiple ways to perceive questions. This paper will cover that concept and how we can utilize certain guidelines to our advantage whether professionally or in everyday life.

According to Eric Raymond [1], there are numerous ways to identify a smart question. The process of creating one starts before it begins. If your question can be easily answered like one quick Google search away, then you don’t need to ask other people. A technical example is “What is the syntax for a For loop in C?” This is applicable to personal questions as well, “Hey Siri, what day of the week is it?” Before asking the question, try to figure it out yourself with effort. Okay… we can’t find an answer. Lets ask around.

Depending where you ask and what’s the context is quite important as it could be disrespectful in some cases. Multiple places to ask include Forums(Reddit, StackOverflow), email, and the comment section of blogs. It should be easily accessible for others to answer your question whether sharing through Google file/sheets, Github repo, your email, or a reply under your post. This part also depends on who’s asking to fulfill their side. Your post should have a concise and clear topic of what needs fixing, any errors encountered, and what troubleshootings steps that have been taken. There’s an emphasis on clear and concise as you don’t want to flood your audience with unnecessary info. In the end, your reader should have a chronological story in mind and be able to present a solution to the goal.

An example that highlights the flaws is this StackOverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12345620/how-to-remove-grey-border-from-facebook-lightbox-pop-up
The user wanted to remove a grey boarder from a pop up within Facebook. This is almost verbatim to his subject and post. It’s fine as a subject, but making the request identical isn’t all helpful. No mention of steps taken, problems stopping the goal, nor a link/picture in the original request. Only then after people posted solutions, did he link a picture of the goal. Not to hate on the user, these comments only aim at the context of the post. It isn’t all bad. People did reply with solutions. We will get into more details about that later in the paper. He correctly tagged the post with {html, jquery, css, facebook}. His goal was upfront and he did reply to the solutions with courtesy. This leads to the outlook of questions from the other perspective.

The other half to smart questions is the presentation. This part has nothing to do with the actual question. How should we present it and in what way? We all have our own way of interpreting questions to be either rhetorical, serious, or jokingly. If you want someone to take your question seriously, ask in a polite manner with some thought behind it. The perception of your question almost always depends on how you phrase it or which way you bring up the topic. This is aside from the fact that the other person can misinterpret your mannerisms or take your question in bad faith. If you're answering the question, you wouldn’t feel like giving a tip if the other person was obnoxious.

This StackOverflow post demonstrates a smart question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79385866/numpy-array-boolean-indexing-to-get-containing-element
There’s already a clear difference between the two post.
