&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There are no dumb questions”. This was said all the time over my academic career. It’s been repeated so much that it goes over my head everytime and I’ve never pondered about it. That is until now. I thought that the statement was true until I learned about smart questions. The quote isn’t entirely wrong, but there are multiple ways to perceive questions. This paper will cover that concept and how we can utilize certain guidelines to our advantage whether professionally or in everyday life.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to Eric Raymond [1], there are numerous ways to identify a smart question. The process of creating one starts before it begins. If your question can be easily answered like one quick Google search away, then you don’t need to ask other people. A technical example is “What is the syntax for a For loop in C?” This is applicable to personal questions as well, “Hey Siri, what day of the week is it?” Before asking the question, try to figure it out yourself with effort. Okay… we can’t find an answer. Lets ask around.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Depending where you ask and what’s the context is quite important as it could be disrespectful in some cases. Multiple places to ask include Forums(Reddit, StackOverflow), email, and the comment section of blogs. It should be easily accessible for others to answer your question whether sharing through Google file/sheets, Github repo, your email, or a reply under your post. This part also depends on who’s asking to fulfill their side. Your post should have a concise and clear topic of what needs fixing, any errors encountered, and what troubleshootings steps that have been taken. There’s an emphasis on clear and concise as you don’t want to flood your audience with unnecessary info. In the end, your reader should have a chronological story in mind and be able to present a solution to the goal.

An example that highlights the flaws is this StackOverflow post: [Non Smart Question Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12345620/how-to-remove-grey-border-from-facebook-lightbox-pop-up)
</div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The user wanted to remove a grey boarder from a pop up within Facebook. This is almost verbatim to his subject and post. It’s fine as a subject, but making the request identical isn’t all helpful. No mention of steps taken, problems stopping the goal, nor a link/picture in the original request. Only then after people posted solutions, did he link a picture of the goal. Not to hate on the user, these comments only aim at the context of the post. It isn’t all bad. People did reply with solutions. We will get into more details about that later in the paper. He correctly tagged the post with {html, jquery, css, facebook}. His goal was upfront and he did reply to the solutions with courtesy. This leads to the outlook of questions from the other perspective.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The other half to smart questions is the presentation. This part has nothing to do with the actual question. How should we present it and in what way? We all have our own way of interpreting questions to be either rhetorical, serious, or jokingly. If you want someone to take your question seriously, ask in a polite manner with some thought behind it. The perception of your question almost always depends on how you phrase it or which way you bring up the topic. This is aside from the fact that the other person can misinterpret your mannerisms or take your question in bad faith. If you're answering the question, you wouldn’t feel like giving a tip if the other person was obnoxious.

This StackOverflow post demonstrates a smart question: [Smart Question Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79385866/numpy-array-boolean-indexing-to-get-containing-element)
</div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The user is using numpy in Python to obtain array elements(subarrays) within an array. This array of subarrays can be considered a matrix of the 3rd dimension. In a singular array element, there are 3 columns each representing coordinate points. He discusses in the question that he wants certain subarrays that fit the conditions based on the coordinate point values. This can be better explained by the first solution who clarifies the OP(original poster). 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Already, there’s a clear difference between the two posts. It includes his struggles, his current code, and an expected result. The question was eloquent and his goal was clear in the subject. The post also had the correct tags {python, numpy}. A drastic improvement was definitely laying out the code, allowing the reader to grasp the context easier. Comparing the solutions from both questions, the response time is alike according to their difficulty. The main contrast is the dedication of the solution. The “smart” question response was more detailed, granted the problem was more complex and the OP didn’t fully understand at first. The “not smart” question was vague in expectation similar to its response. There’s some correlation you could get of this especially after remembering another life quote, “Treat others how you want to be treated.” Rather than being negative on the first post, I think it’s a testament to the community for helping each other whether the request is “smart” or “not smart.”

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all that said, how does this apply to “smart” software engineers? Well as the saying goes in the last section, collaboration. Depending on the situation, there can be obvious or abstract problems that we need to figure out. How we figure them out as a community of developers relies on us to put in the effort and cooperate. Alongside helping one another, each individual must put in the effort to improve their own skills and understanding. Identifying “smart” questions is a part of that process. Knowing how that's done has now given me a tool that I can utilize when asking or answering others’ questions.
