&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Specifically Software Engineering. The first major I took in college was computer science. My older brother was a fellow alumni in computer science and I wanted to follow in his footsteps. After my first year in Computer Science with Java programming, I quit. I didn’t want to stare at a screen and identify bugs for a whole day. I didn’t like the idea of constantly programming especially during the COVID era. At the time, that was my perception of computer science. When I look back at my younger self, I wish he could have stuck with the degree for a little longer. There’s more than just programming; it’s a lifestyle or a way of thinking. The career field is vast amongst evolving technologies. That’s what I’ve come to learn during my current major, Computer Engineering.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s ironic that I went to another degree with computer in the name and similar material, career pathways, and workload. Both degrees encompass similar topics that branch into almost identical careers. Though, there is a difference that is the inclusion of Electrical Engineering opening more possibilities within the tech field. Besides that, my perception of Computer Science has drastically changed since I left. It wasn’t all the programming that I disliked, but the feeling of being overwhelmed. I didn’t push myself to overcome the challenge of helplessness and wanted to move on. That’s not right. This time, I want to amend any regret with the bountiful knowledge that I gained on my journey.

## Athletic Software Engineering

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can’t be narrow minded as there are many fields within Computer Science: data scientist, cybersecurity, machine learning, software developer, and etc. My welcome back dives into Software Engineering. WIthin the first couple weeks of taking a course in this field, I’ve experienced a ton of practical knowledge that could be applicable to my future career. The idea of Athletic Software Engineering is the core motivation behind this gain. Weekly WODs (Workouts of the Day), intensive practice sessions of numerous skills, and collaborative or independent projects. These are prime examples to a deeper mindset of learning. Software engineering by itself contains a lot of topics to cover, but the effort to learn and understand the concepts stems from the teaching methodology. Having a rigorous learning environment develops these skills. The athletic part makes us do exercise after exercise like sports but for our brain.

## Typescript Thoughts

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All of this buildup leads to the first new skills that I’ve learned in my return. Javascript and Typescript. It’s not bad. As a starting point, the language is great to learn as it’s used for practical web development. I heard Typescript also makes Javascript easier, but I don't have enough experience to make that judgement. Over my academic career, there've been so many languages that I interacted with like C/C++, Python, Assembly, Java, SQL and more. Typescript is amongst the top that I can see myself using for a future job. Web development is such an interesting pathway to take and probably what I would do if I stayed in Computer Science. Adapting to this language has been easier due to previous programming experience especially in Object Oriented with objects and interfaces. This can be attributed back to Athletic Software Engineering.

## Conclusion

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In my concluding thoughts, the first couple of weeks using Typescript has been enjoyable and I want to continue to keep pushing myself to be better everyday. The concepts were simple and similar to other languages, but the effort in practicing and having an open mindset for creativity will play a huge factor in learning. I want to learn as much in web development.
